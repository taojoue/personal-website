# Personal Website of Tao JOUET

Personal website for my resume and portfolio. See the road map for future features 😊

It's currently deployed on my Raspberry Pi at home. I've been able to manage how to make it work headless and add ftp to deploy newer versions regularly. My main objective with this site is to showcase all my abilities in computer science and to progress daily. I will be updating it regularly as I become better at programming.

Follow along for this cool adventure. If you have any suggestion feel free to start a discussion so we could talk about it ! 

## What's done :
  * "Standard" pages
  * Routing
